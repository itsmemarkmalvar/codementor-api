# Free Tier Optimization Strategy for Multiple Users

## Current Situation
- **Free Tier Limits**: 1,500 requests/day for Gemini
- **Split-screen feature**: Uses BOTH Gemini + Together AI per message
- **Problem**: Each user message = 2 API calls (1 to each model)

## üéØ Solution: Use Together AI as Primary, Gemini as Secondary

### Strategy Overview
Since you're running 2 AI models in parallel, you can optimize by:
1. **Primary AI**: Together AI (your main response provider)
2. **Backup AI**: Gemini (fallback only when Together fails)
3. **OR**: Let users CHOOSE which AI they want (not both at once)

This way, you save 50% of Gemini quota immediately!

## Option 1: User Choice (Recommended) ‚≠ê
**Change split-screen to single AI mode:**
- User selects either Gemini OR Together (not both)
- Saves 50% quota on both services
- Still provides AI comparison when needed

### Benefits:
- 1,500 Gemini requests/day ‚Üí supports **1,500 user messages/day**
- ~100 active users √ó 15 messages/day = 1,500 messages ‚úÖ
- Can switch between models if one hits quota

---

## Option 2: Together AI Primary + Gemini Fallback
**Make Together AI the default:**
- Only call Gemini if Together AI fails or hits quota
- Most requests use Together AI (free tier: 60 requests/min)
- Gemini becomes emergency backup

### Benefits:
- Saves 90% of Gemini quota
- More reliable (failover protection)
- Together AI has better free tier for this use case

---

## Option 3: Smart Model Router
**Intelligently route requests:**
- Simple questions ‚Üí Together AI only
- Complex explanations ‚Üí Gemini only
- Code review ‚Üí Both AIs
- User can toggle split-screen on/off

---

## Option 4: Use Flash-Lite (Least Impact)
**Switch to gemini-2.5-flash-lite:**
- Uses ~40% fewer tokens
- Extends quota from 750 ‚Üí ~1,200 effective messages/day
- Still uses dual AI system
- **Easiest to implement** (just change .env)

## üìä Comparison Table

| Strategy | Daily User Messages | Active Users | Implementation |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Current (dual AI) | ~750 | 30-40 | Already done |
| Flash-Lite | ~1,200 | 50-60 | 2 minutes |
| User Choice | ~1,500 | 100+ | 1-2 hours |
| Together Primary | ~1,400 | 90+ | 2-3 hours |
| Smart Router | ~2,000 | 130+ | 4-6 hours |

## üí° Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (5 minutes)
1. Switch to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` for 60% more capacity
2. This alone gets you from 750 ‚Üí 1,200 messages/day

### Phase 2: Short-term (1-2 hours)
1. Add a toggle in split-screen: "Show single AI" vs "Compare both AIs"
2. Default to single AI mode (user's preference: Gemini or Together)
3. Advanced users can enable dual comparison mode

### Phase 3: Long-term (if needed)
1. Implement quota monitoring
2. Automatically switch to backup AI when primary hits quota
3. Show usage stats to users

## üöÄ Quick Win: Implement Phase 1 Now

Would you like me to:
1. **Switch to flash-lite** (5 min, +60% capacity) ‚úÖ Easy
2. **Add single-AI toggle** (1-2 hours, +100% capacity) üéØ Best ROI
3. **Implement smart routing** (longer, +150% capacity) üîß Advanced

Let me know which approach you prefer!
